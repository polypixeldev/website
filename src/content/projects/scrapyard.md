<a href="https://scrapyard.hackclub.com">Scrapyard</a> was <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>'s 2025 winter hackathon, with a flagship event in Austin, TX on March 1st and 2nd, and then local events around the world on March 15th and 16th. I got the incredible opportunity to help organize Scrapyard and attend the flagship event. A lot goes into organizing an event like Scrapyard that I didn't realize before, but I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm working on something bigger about my experience organizing Scrapyard, but for now, here's the awesome video about the event!
