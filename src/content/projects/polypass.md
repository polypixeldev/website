Polypass was my first decently large and complex project. It was also my first time building a cross-platform app (Polypass currently supports Linux (arm64 and amd64), Windows, and Android). For this reason, working on Polypass has definitely been an adventure, but most of all a learning experience.

# Why

I started working on Polypass because of a couple reasons:

- I wanted a new project to work on
- I was unhappy with KeepassXC, which I was using at the time (My main issues were the look and synchronization)

# What

Polypass is a simple, secure, and easy to use password manager. It supports Linux, Windows, and Android, and has built-in synchronization via FTP. All data is encrypted using AES-256.
