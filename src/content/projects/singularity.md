Singularity was my very first programming project. I started working on Singularity when I was just beginning to learn modern JavaScript. Over time, it's evolved from a simple Discord bot with a couple commands to a complete, general-purpose bot with a plethora of useful commands, and even a web app to complement the bot. It uses MongoDB for a database, and was originally written in JavaScript. When I decided to start learning TypeScript (and discovered how amazing it was), I migrated Singularity to use TypeScript.
