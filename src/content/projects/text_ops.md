Text Ops is a small project that I developed to try out the amazing Tauri toolkit. However, it's also a useful app that I use from time to time whenever I need to make some funny text. After making Text Ops, I'm amazed at how great Tauri is for making cross-platform desktop apps. I also got to try out Rust, which I enjoyed working with (although not a lot of Rust code was needed for Text Ops).
