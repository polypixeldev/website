On November 23rd, 2024, 50+ events around the world begun as part of [Counterspell](https://counterspell.hackclub.com), a beginner-friendly game jam for teens. Counterspell Tampa was the event for teens in the Tampa area, although people also came from other parts of Florida!

With 6 organizers & 9 participants, 4 unique games were made at Counterspell Tampa. 2 games won the local event prizes, and participants later submitted their games to compete for the Counterspell Global Awards.

I was a lead organizer along with 5 other awesome people on the organizing team, and plan to help organize many more events in the area.
