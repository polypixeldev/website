# Why

The inspiration and purpose for ComputerStacks comes from my own experiences as a student trying to learn how to code.

I've always been interested in coding, ever since I discovered [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). However, it took me a long time to find the right resources that taught me what I wanted to learn well. This can be the issue with so much tech resources; it's great that you can learn everything online, but if you don't know what the good resources are, you won't learn it well.

The obvious way to get started is just by looking for resources using Google (or any other search engine). However, search engines don't do computer-related topics justice. Just search for "how to make a website" on Google and you'll get a a ton of low-quality "How to make a website in 9 easy steps" results. Not very useful, right? This is the problem that ComputerStacks aims to solve.

# What

Put simply, ComputerStacks is a digital collection of computer-related resources and support. With ComputerStacks, you can search using either the search bar, through the structured catalog, or by going throguh a roadmap. The resources you'll get from ComputerStacks aren't indexed and ranked by a computer algorithm - they've been chosen by real humans that actually found the resources to be accurate and useful.
